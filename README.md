# Private-Code-AccessDenialWarning
Hello there,

Welcome to my GitHub page. You've stumbled upon a repository created to safeguard some personal projects I've been diligently working on, along with their original source code. While some of these projects may be listed on my resume, it's important to note that not all source code is intended for public consumption.

If you're here seeking more information about a specific project, I encourage you to reach out to me via email. I'll be more than happy to provide you with further details.

Thank you for your understanding and respecting the privacy of my projects.

Best regards,
Faisal
